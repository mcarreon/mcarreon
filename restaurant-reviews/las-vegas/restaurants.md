Came here for dinner because I was craving ramen, and I really didn't feel like driving all the way to Chinatown. Ordered the takoyaki and the tonkotsu ramen. Service was pretty good, interior was alright, nothing too crazy. Prices were ok (given the price increase everywhere), was $22 dollars with tip.

The takoyaki was the standout in the order, very flavorful. I only wish the inside had a bit more texture, as after biting through the crispy outside, the inside was pretty much a soft mush. Very small amount of squid here but still had that squid flavor.

The ramen was ok, for $12.95 I think it was not too bad. Nothing to write home about though, the flavor was pretty muted, and reminded me more of a very dressed up ramen pack (which is not a that bad of thing imo). It didn't have that slightly sticky texture you get when you sip a good ramen broth, and the chashu was not great. A bit chewy, and there was no satisfying fat flavor. I would probably not order this again.

Overall, good for a cheap lunch/dinner, the tsukemen looks really good so I may try that if I go back. I would generally stay away from the regular ramen unless you're really craving a ramen.
