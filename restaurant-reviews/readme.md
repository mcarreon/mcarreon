# Restaurant Reviews

I was trying to figure out a way that I could write reviews for restaurants I've been to without affecting their Yelp (atleast in most cases, if the experience was really that egregious I guess I'd leave a review).

Generally I try not to rate restaurants on a numbered scale but I'd rather do something like:

```text
Would avoid
Would generally not come back
Would go again if craving it specifically
Would go again often
Would go back asap
```

Reviews are separated by city, and possibly by type of cuisine if I feel like organizing it more in the future.

These reviews are more for me to remember what places I liked and I didn't like, but feel free to use it as reference :+1:
